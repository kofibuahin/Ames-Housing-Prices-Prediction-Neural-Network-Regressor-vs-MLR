# Ames-Housing-Prices-Prediction-Neural-Network-Regressor-vs-MLR

This project was a part of my Independent Research project conducted on Neural Networks. I wanted to test the performance of a trained Multi-Layer Peceptron Neural Network regressor versus a traditional linear regression model so I entered Kaggle's Housing Prices Advanced Regression Learning Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) and submitted predictions generated from the two separate models.

Please feel free to follow the process for the development of the two separate models in the "Neural Network - Deliverable 1_Regression - Final Script.ipynb" file that has been uploaded to this repository on github.
